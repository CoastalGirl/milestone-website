                   <p>The Rogue Pickings project is a static website project from my SkillCrush.com blueprint classwork. The purpose behind this project was to provide students with the opportunity to practice writing HTML and CSS code. We were provided with the PSD template and were required to turn it into code. Students are supported but the coding and the styling is all ours.</p><br/>
